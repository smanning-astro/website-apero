excerpt: New surveys reveal a significant population of distant galaxies which had gone undetected in the deepest available optical and near-infrared observations. 
layout: single
subtitle: A purposefully vague umbrella term, "NIR-dark" describes a wide array of distant and dust-obscured galaxies detected in surveys with varying wavelength coverage and depth. Our challenge is now to disentangle the distinct galaxy populations which may exist within this broad framework.
