### Primary Science Goals

- Discover and characterize 6<z<11 galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization

- Identify rare quiescent galaxies at z>4

- Directly measure the evolution of the stellar mass to halo relation out to z~2.5

### How do I plan to utilize COSMOS-Web?

I am particularly excited to revisit our NIR-dark dusty galaxies with these _JWST_ observations. The increased photometric coverage will drastically improve their photmetric redshift estimates and allow us to place much firmer constraints on their stellar masses and star formation rates. Additionally, we will be able to assess their rest-frame optical sizes and morphologies for the first time.

Observations of the full field will be completed by January 2024.
