### Primary Science Goals

- Discover and characterize 6<z<11 galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization

- Identify rare quiescent galaxies at z>4

- Directly measure the evolution of the stellar mass to halo relation out to z~2.5

I am particularly interested in using these _JWST_ observations to revisit our NIR-dark dusty galaxies and place firm constraints on their stellar masses, sizes, and morphologies.
