excerpt: The Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA Survey searches for redshift > 4 dusty star-forming galaxies at 2mm.
layout: single
subtitle: A purposefully vague umbrella term, "NIR-dark" describes a wide array of distant and dust-obscured galaxies detected in surveys with varying wavelength coverage and depth. Our challenge is now to disentangle the distinct galaxy populations which may exist within this broad framework.
