excerpt: The Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA Survey searches for redshift > 4 dusty star-forming galaxies at 2mm.
layout: single
subtitle: The Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA Survey is the largest 2mm mosaic taken to-date with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. The purpose of the survey is to search for high-redshift (z>3) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs).

### Above: MORA coverage map within the COSMOS extragalactic field. The teal regions show the mosaics produced from the original survey, while the green region illustrates the approved extended map (Ex-MORA), the observations for which are now largely in hand.

The survey was motivated by the limited sample size of known high redshift DSFGs and a lack of understanding regarding their volume density and contribution to cosmic star formation in the early Universe. Additionally, it was based on the hypothesis that conducting the survey at 2mm would be an effective strategey to filter out lower redshift interlopers which dominate shorter wavelength (e.g. 850 micron - 1 millimeter) surveys.
