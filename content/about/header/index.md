I didn't always know I wanted to be an astronomer. In fact, until about the age of 12 I was convinced I was going to be a dentist. By my sophomore year of college, though, with the help of several invaluable mentors that I still rely on today, I decided to switch my major to physics and see where this astronomy thing could take me. All around the world it turns out!
